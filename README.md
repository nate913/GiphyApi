I created a WWE superstars app full of gifs using the giphy api!!!
I made an array of actions and made buttons out of them.
When you click on a button, 20 images are retrieved from giphy and displayed on the page.
When you click on the image, the gif plays. When you click again, the gif stops playing.
Yu can add a new WWE superstar from the search form at the top of the page. After you click the submity button the superstar will be added to the array of superstars and added as a new button
The rating of each gif will also appear on the page.
